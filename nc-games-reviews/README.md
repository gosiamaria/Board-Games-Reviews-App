## Description
Northcoders Boardgames reviews board app is a platform on which users can access reviews for different boardgames, vote on them as well as leave a comment. The reviews can be sorted by date, title or votes in either an ascending or descending order. The user can also limit the number of reviews they want to view per page or 'View all' if they wish to.

The user can also select a category to view reviews only for that specific category.

In order to leave and/or delete comments, the user needs to be logged in and is only able to delete their own comments.
